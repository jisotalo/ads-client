Beckhoff TwinCAT ADS client library for Node.js (unofficial). Connects to Beckhoff TwinCAT automation systems using ADS protocol.

Coded from scratch using [TwinCAT ADS specification](https://infosys.beckhoff.com/content/1033/tc3_ads_intro/116157835.html?id=124964102706356243) and [Beckhoff.TwinCAT.Ads nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Beckhoff.TwinCAT.Ads/5.0.0-preview6). Inspiration from similar projects like [node-ads](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-ads), [beckhoff-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/beckhoff-js) and [iecstruct](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iecstruct).

There is automatically created documentation available at https://jisotalo.github.io/ads-client/

# Project status

# Connection setups and possibilities

The ads-client can be used in different system configurations. The following figure has different possible setups:

[![ads-client-setups](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13457157/82724547-8dde0800-9cdf-11ea-8dd1-0a1f06f8559f.PNG)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13457157/82724547-8dde0800-9cdf-11ea-8dd1-0a1f06f8559f.PNG)

## Setup 1 - Connect from Windows PC to the PLC

Suggested use cases:
- When using Windows operating system and TwinCAT runtime can be installed
- When opening a TCP port from PLC is a no-go

Requirements:
- Client has TwinCAT runtime or XAE installed 
- ADS route is created between the client and the PLC


Example connection to PLC with AmsNetId of `192.168.1.120.1.1`.
```js
const client = new ads.Client({
  targetAmsNetId: '192.168.1.120.1.1',
  targetAdsPort: 851,
})
```

## Setup 2 - Connecting from Unix/Windows/etc. system to the PLC

Suggested use cases:
- On Windows when TwinCAT installation is not possible, but .NET Core is available
- Unix based system and .NET Core available

Requirements:
- Client has [AdsRouterConsole](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Beckhoff.TwinCAT.Ads.AdsRouterConsole/5.0.0-preview4) running
- ADS route is created between the client and the PLC (as in the nuget package instructions)

Example connection when PLC has AmsNetId of `192.168.1.120.1.1`.
```js
const client = new ads.Client({
  targetAmsNetId: '192.168.1.120.1.1',
  targetAdsPort: 851,
})
```



## Setup 3 - Connecting from any Node.js supported system to the PLC

Suggested use cases:
- When opening TCP port from PLC is possible
- When fast connection is required (1 router less -> faster response)

Requirements:
- NOTE: Only one connection / client is possible!
- PLC has TCP port 48898 open (default router port)
  - NOTE: Windows Firewall might block, make sure Ethernet connection is handled as "private"
- Local AmsNetId and ADS port are given manually
  - Given `localAmsNetId` is not already in use
  - Given `localAdsPort` is not already in use
- PLC has ADS route manually created to client IP address and client `localAmsNetId`
  - See example after code sample

Example connection when PLC has AmsNetId of `192.168.1.120.1.1` and IP of `192.168.1.120`.
```js
const client = new ads.Client({
  localAmsNetId: '192.168.1.10.1.1',  //Can be anything but needs to be in PLC StaticRoutes.xml file
  localAdsPort: 32750,                //Can be anything that is not used
  targetAmsNetId: '192.168.1.120.1.1',
  targetAdsPort: 851,
  routerAddress: '192.168.1.120',     //PLC ip address
  routerTcpPort: 48898                //PLC needs to have this port opened. Test disabling all firewalls if problems
})
```

Adding a route to the PLC can be done editing `TwinCAT\3.1\Target\StaticRoutes.xml` file from PLC. Add the following inside `<RemoteConnections>` tag. In this example, client should use meanual AmsNetId `192.168.1.10.1.1` and client has IP address `192.168.1.10`.
```xml
<Route>
  <Name>UI</Name>
  <Address>192.168.1.10</Address>
  <NetId>192.168.1.10.1.1</NetId>
  <Type>TCP_IP</Type>
  <Flags>64</Flags>
</Route>
```

See also [this issue comment](https://github.com/jisotalo/ads-client/issues/51#issuecomment-758016428) by hansipete for one possible way how to do adding the route.

## Setup 4 - Connect to the localhost (PLC and client on the same machine)

Suggested use cases:
- When testing PLC systems on the local computer
- When using panel PC/PLC combination
- When PLC has monitor and it's used as user interface


Requirements:
- AMS router TCP loopback enabled (see [Enabling localhost support](#enabling-localhost-support))

Example connection to local PLC runtime

```js
const client = new ads.Client({
  targetAmsNetId: '127.0.0.1.1.1', //or 'localhost'
  targetAdsPort: 851,
})

```


# Enabling localhost support on TwinCAT 3
*NOTE: Only required for TwinCAT 3 versions older than 4024.5. Newer versions should have this already enabled.*

***Note:** Probably not working for TwinCAT 2*

If you want to connect to the local TwinCAT runtime (Node.js and the TwinCAT on the same computer - **as example setup 4**), the ADS router TCP loopback feature has to be enabled. Tested with TwinCAT 4022.27 and 4024.4.

The following method is from [Beckhoff.TwinCAT.Ads nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Beckhoff.TwinCAT.Ads/5.0.0-preview6) installation guide.

1. Stop TwinCAT System Service

2. Open registery editor (`regedit`)

3. Depending on the operating system, navigate to 
```
32 bit operating system:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Beckhoff\TwinCAT3\System\

64 bit it operating system:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Beckhoff\TwinCAT3\System\
```

4. Create new DWORD registery named `EnableAmsTcpLoopback` and set value to 1 (example figure below from 64 bit system)

![ads-client-tcp-loopback](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13457157/82748398-2640bf00-9daa-11ea-98e5-0032b3537969.png)

5. Restart TwinCAT system

Now you can connect to the localhost using `targetAmsNetId` address of `127.0.0.1.1.1` or `localhost`.

# IMPORTANT: Writing STRUCT variables

When writing a struct using `writeSymbol`, the given Javascript object keys are handled as case-insensitive because the TwinCAT 3 system is case-insensitive.

In practise this means that the following Javascript objects are used as-equals if passing to the `writeSymbol` method:

```js
{
  sometext: 'hello',
  somereal: 3.14
}
```

```js
{
  SOmeTEXT: 'hello',
  SOMEreal: 3.14
}
```

**NOTE** If the object has multiple keys with same name, `writeSymbol` tries to find the same case as in PLC. If it's not found, it depends on the `Object.find()` method which one is selected.

```js
//In this case, probably the first one (sometext) is selected and the SOMEtext is skipped.
{
  sometext: 'hello',
  SOMEtext: 'good day'
}
```


# IMPORTANT: Things to know when using with TwinCAT 2

Almost everything should work with TwinCAT 2 but please understand the following

## TwinCAT 2 first PLC runtime ADS port is 801 instead of 851

```js
const client = new ads.Client({
  targetAmsNetId: '...', 
  targetAdsPort: 801, //NOTE
})
```

## Variable names are returned in UPPERCASE on TC2 systems
This might cause problems if your app is used with both TC2 & TC3 systems.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13457157/86540055-96df0d80-bf0a-11ea-8f94-7e04515213c2.png)

## Global variable paths are given different on TC2

The GVL name is not given, dot (.) is used instead.

```js
await client.readSymbol('GVL_Test.ExampleSTRUCT') //TwinCAT 3
await client.readSymbol('.ExampleSTRUCT') //TwinCAT 2
```

## InvokeRpcMethod is not possible on TC2
This is the only one non-working feature as there are no methods in TC2.


# Getting started

This chapter includes some short getting started examples. See the JSDoc [documentation](#documentation) for detailed description of library classes and methods.


## Data types used in getting started

These examples assume that the PLC has the following Global Variable List (GVL):
```
//GVL_Test
VAR_GLOBAL
  TestINT           : INT := 1234;
  TestSTRING        : STRING := 'Hello this is a test string';
  ExampleSTRUCT     : ST_Example;
  TestARRAY         : ARRAY[0..4] OF INT := [0, 10, 200, 3000, 4000];
  TestARRAY2        : ARRAY[0..4] OF ST_Example := [(SomeText := 'Just for demo purposes')];
  TestENUM          : E_TestEnum := E_TestEnum.Running;
  IncrementingValue : INT; //This should change every 500 ms or so
  TestTimer         : TON := (PT := T#2S500MS);
END_VAR
```

The `ST_Example` should be defined as below:
```
TYPE ST_Example :
STRUCT
	SomeText : STRING(50) := 'Hello ads-client';
	SomeReal : REAL := 3.14159265359;
	SomeDate : DT := DT#2020-4-13-12:25:33;
END_STRUCT
END_TYPE
```

The `E_TestEnum` should be defined as below:
```
TYPE E_TestEnum :
(
	Disabled 	:= 0,
	Starting 	:= 50,
	Running 	:= 100,
	Stopping	:= 200	
);
END_TYPE
```

## Creating a new Client instance

The constructor takes settings as its parameter. Two settings are mandatory: `targetAmsNetId` and `targetAdsPort`. The first is the target PLC system AmsNetId (like *127.0.0.1.1.1* or *192.168.1.10.1.1*) and the latter is target system ADS port (*like 851 for TwinCAT 3 runtime 1*).

See all settings from the [Settings documentation](https://jisotalo.github.io/ads-client/global.html#Settings)

```js
const ads = require('ads-client')

//Creates a new Client instance and sets the local system and TC3 runtime 1 as target
const client = new ads.Client({
  targetAmsNetId: '127.0.0.1.1.1', //Loopback address, same as 'localhost' since version 1.1.0
  targetAdsPort: 851,
})
```


## Connecting and disconnecting

Connecting to the local TwinCAT 3 runtime 1 (port is 851) using local ADS router (= you have TwinCAT ADS router installed).

```js
const ads = require('ads-client')

const client = new ads.Client({
  targetAmsNetId: '127.0.0.1.1.1',
  targetAdsPort: 851
})

client.connect()
  .then(res => {   
    console.log(`Connected to the ${res.targetAmsNetId}`)
    console.log(`Router assigned us AmsNetId ${res.localAmsNetId} and port ${res.localAdsPort}`)

    return client.disconnect()
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Disconnected')
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.log('Something failed:', err)
  })

/*
Example console output:

Connected to the 127.0.0.1.1.1
Router assigned us AmsNetId 192.168.1.1.1.1 and port 36837
Disconnected
*/
```


## Reading any type PLC variable

Using `readSymbol` method it is possible to read variables of **any type** from the PLC (except references and pointers). These include base scalar type variables, structs, function blocks, arrays and so on. These examples cover just a few cases.

See full `readSymbol` documentation [from the docs](https://jisotalo.github.io/ads-client/Client.html#readSymbol).

For references and pointers see chapter [Reading and writing POINTER TO and REFERENCE TO variables](#reading-and-writing-pointer-to-and-reference-to-variables).

### Example: Reading `INT` type variable
```js
//Using Promises
client.readSymbol('GVL_Test.TestSTRING')
  .then(res => {
    console.log(`Value read: ${res.value}`)
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.log('Something failed:', err)
  })

/*
Example console output:

Value read: 1234
*/
```

---

### Example: Reading `STRING` type variable
```js
client.readSymbol('GVL_Test.TestSTRING')
  .then(res => {
    console.log(`Value read: ${res.value}`)
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.log('Something failed:', err)
  })
/*
Example console output:

Value read: Hello this is a test string
*/
```

---



### Example: Reading `ENUM` type variable

If setting `objectifyEnumerations` is set to false, only ENUM value (number) is returned. As default, both string representation and integer value are returned.

```js 
//objectifyEnumerations: true
client.readSymbol('GVL_Test.TestENUM')
  .then(res => {
    console.log(`Value read: ${res.value}`)
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.log('Something failed:', err)
  })

/*
Example console output:

Value read: { name: 'Running', value: 100 }
*/
```

---


### Example: Reading `STRUCT` type variable


```js
//Using await for example purposes
try {
  const res = await client.readSymbol('GVL_Test.ExampleSTRUCT')

  console.log('Value read:', res.value)
} catch (err) {
  console.log('Reading failed:', err)
}

/*
Example console output:

Value read: { SomeText: 'Hello ads-client',
  SomeReal: 3.1415927410125732,
  SomeDate: 2020-04-13T12:25:33.000Z }   
*/
```

---



### Example: Reading `ARRAY OF INT` type variable


```js
try {
  const res = await client.readSymbol('GVL_Test.TestARRAY')

  console.log('Value read:', res.value)
} catch (err) {
  console.log('Reading failed:', err)
}

/*
Example console output:

Value read: [ 0, 10, 200, 3000, 4000 ] 
*/
```

---

### Example: Reading `ARRAY OF STRUCT` type variable

```javascript
try {
  const res = await client.readSymbol('GVL_Test.TestARRAY2')

  console.log('Value read:', res.value)
} catch (err) {
  console.log('Reading failed:', err)
}

/*
Example console output:

Value read: [ { SomeText: 'Just for demo purposes',
    SomeReal: 3.1415927410125732,
    SomeDate: 2020-04-13T12:25:33.000Z },
  { SomeText: 'Hello ads-client',
    SomeReal: 3.1415927410125732,
    SomeDate: 2020-04-13T12:25:33.000Z },
  { SomeText: 'Hello ads-client',
    SomeReal: 3.1415927410125732,
    SomeDate: 2020-04-13T12:25:33.000Z },
  { SomeText: 'Hello ads-client',
    SomeReal: 3.1415927410125732,
    SomeDate: 2020-04-13T12:25:33.000Z },
  { SomeText: 'Hello ads-client',
    SomeReal: 3.1415927410125732,
    SomeDate: 2020-04-13T12:25:33.000Z } ]
*/
```


----

### Example: Reading `FUNCTION BLOCK` type variable

Example of reading `TON` timer function block.

```javascript
try {
  const res = await client.readSymbol('GVL_Test.TestTimer')

  console.log('Value read:', res.value)
} catch (err) {
  console.log('Reading failed:', err)
}

/*
Example console output:

Value read: { IN: false, PT: 2500, Q: false, ET: 0, M: false, StartTime: 0 }
*/
```

## Writing any type PLC variable

Using `writeSymbol` method it is possible to write variables of **any type** to the PLC (except references and pointers). These include base scalar type variables, structs, function blocks, arrays and so on. These examples cover just a few cases.

See full `writeSymbol` documentation [from the docs](https://jisotalo.github.io/ads-client/Client.html#writeSymbol).

For references and pointers see chapter [Reading and writing POINTER TO and REFERENCE TO variables](#reading-and-writing-pointer-to-and-reference-to-variables).

---

### Example: Writing `INT` type variable


```js
try {
  const res = await client.writeSymbol('GVL_Test.TestINT', 5)

  console.log('Value written:', res.value)
} catch (err) {
  console.log('Something failed:', err)
}
```

---

### Example: Writing `STRING` type variable

```js

try {
  const res = await client.writeSymbol('GVL_Test.TestSTRING', 'Changing the string value to this')

  console.log('Value written:', res.value)
} catch (err) {
  console.log('Something failed:', err)
}
```


---

### Example: Writing `ENUM` type variable

When writing `ENUM` value, it can always be given as number or string.


```js 
try {
  const res = await client.writeSymbol('GVL_Test.TestENUM', 'Starting')
  //The following does the same:
  //const res = await client.writeSymbol('GVL_Test.TestENUM', 50)

  console.log('Value written:', res.value)
} catch (err) {
  console.log('Something failed:', err)
}
```

---
### Example: Writing `STRUCT` type variable

```js
try {
  const res = await client.writeSymbol('GVL_Test.ExampleSTRUCT', {
    SomeText: 'Hello to you too, Mr. PLC!',
    SomeReal: 5456.06854,
    SomeDate: new Date()
  })

  console.log('Value written:', res.value)
} catch (err) {
  console.log('Something failed:', err)
}
```


### Example: Writing `STRUCT` type variable (with autoFill parameter)

---

The following code will not work. The PLC struct has three members but we provide only two, which causes an exception.


```js
//NOTE: This won't work
try {
  const res = await client.writeSymbol('GVL_Test.ExampleSTRUCT', {
    SomeReal: 123.45,
    SomeText: 'This will not work...'
  })

} catch (err) {
  console.log('Something failed:', err)
}

/*
Example console output

Something failed: { ClientException: Writing symbol GVL_Test.ExampleSTRUCT failed: Given Javascript object is missing key/value for at least ".SomeDate" (DATE_AND_TIME) - Set writeSymbol() 3rd parameter (autoFill) to true to allow uncomplete objects
    at Promise ...
*/
```

We need to tell the `WriteSymbol` that we **indeed** want to write just some members and the rest will stay the same. This happens by setting the 3rd parameter `autoFill` to true.

If `autoFill` is true, the method first reads the latest value and then writes it with only the new given changes.

```js
try {
  const res = await client.writeSymbol('GVL_Test.ExampleSTRUCT', {
    SomeReal: 123.45,
    SomeText: 'But this works!'
  }, true) //Note this!

  console.log('Value written:', res.value)

} catch (err) {
  console.log('Something failed:', err)
}
```


Of course, it would be possible to do with two separate commands too:
```js
res = await client.writeSymbol('GVL_Test.ExampleSTRUCT.SomeReal', 123.45)
res = await client.writeSymbol('GVL_Test.ExampleSTRUCT.SomeText', 'This is also possible')
```

---

### Example: Writing `ARRAY OF INT` type variable

```js
try {
  const res = await client.writeSymbol('GVL_Test.TestArray', [9999, 8888, 6666, 5555, 4444])

  console.log('Value written:', res.value)

} catch (err) {
  console.log('Something failed:', err)
  return
}
```

---

### Example: Writing `ARRAY of STRUCT` type variable

```js
try {
  const res = await client.writeSymbol('GVL_Test.TestArray', 
    [ { SomeText: 'First value',
        SomeReal: 1.0,
        SomeDate: new Date()},
      { SomeText: 'Second',
        SomeReal: 10.10,
        SomeDate: new Date()},
      { SomeText: 'Third',
        SomeReal: 20.20,
        SomeDate: new Date()},
      { SomeText: 'Fourth',
        SomeReal: 30.30,
        SomeDate: new Date()},
      { SomeText: 'Fifth',
        SomeReal: 40.40,
        SomeDate: new Date()}]
  )

  console.log('Value written:', res.value)
  
} catch (err) {
  console.log('Something failed:', err)
  return
}
```

---
### Example: Writing `FUNCTION BLOCK` type variable

Starting a timer from Node.js and setting time to 60 seconds.

**NOTE:** Using autoFill parameter to keep the rest as-is.
```js
try {
  const res = await client.writeSymbol('GVL_Test.TestTimer', {
    IN: true, 
    PT: 60000,
  }, true)

  console.log('Value written:', res.value)
} catch (err) {
  console.log('Something failed:', err)
}

/*
Example console output

Value written: { IN: true, PT: 60000, Q: false, ET: 0, M: false, StartTime: 0 }
*/
```

## Subscribing to PLC variables (device notifications)

By using `subscribe` method, we can receive variable values automatically from the PLC if they change or periodically.

See full `subscribe` documentation [from the docs](https://jisotalo.github.io/ads-client/Client.html#subscribe).

---

### Subcribe to variable value (on-change)


The following wants the PLC to check if the value has changed every 1000 milliseconds. If it has changed, callback is called with the latest value in `data` parameter.

After 10 seconds the subscription is unsubscribed.

```js
try {
  let subscription = await client.subscribe('GVL_Test.IncrementingValue', (data, sub) => {
    //Note: The sub parameter is the same as returned by client.subcribe()
    console.log(`${data.timeStamp}: Value changed to ${data.value}`)

  }, 1000)

  console.log(`Subscribed to ${subscription.target}`)

  //Unsubscribe and disconnect after 10 seconds
  setTimeout((async () => {
    //The subscribe() returns object that contains unsubscribe() method
    await subscription.unsubscribe()

    console.log('Unsubscribed')
  }), 10000)

} catch (err) {
  console.log('Something failed:', err)
  return
}

/*
Example console output

Subscribed to GVL_Test.IncrementingValue
Mon Apr 13 2020 13:02:26 GMT+0300 (GMT+03:00): Value changed to 1586
Mon Apr 13 2020 13:02:27 GMT+0300 (GMT+03:00): Value changed to 1588
Mon Apr 13 2020 13:02:28 GMT+0300 (GMT+03:00): Value changed to 1590
...
Mon Apr 13 2020 13:02:34 GMT+0300 (GMT+03:00): Value changed to 1602
Unsubscribed
```

---

### Subcribe to variable value (cyclic)

The following wants the PLC to send the variable value every 1000 milliseconds. The callback is called with the latest value in `data` parameter (it might have changed or not).

```js
//Our callback function
const onChange = (data, sub) => {
  console.log(`${data.timeStamp}: ${sub.target} changed to ${data.value}`)

  //We can call sub.unsubscribe() here if we want
}

try {
  let subscription = await client.subscribe('GVL_Test.IncrementingValue', onChange, 1000, false)

  console.log(`Subscribed to ${subscription.target}`)

} catch (err) {
  console.log('Something failed:', err)
  return
}

/*
Example console output


Subscribed to GVL_Test.IncrementingValue
Mon Apr 13 2020 13:09:04 GMT+0300 (GMT+03:00): GVL_Test.IncrementingValue changed to 273
Mon Apr 13 2020 13:09:05 GMT+0300 (GMT+03:00): GVL_Test.IncrementingValue changed to 275
Mon Apr 13 2020 13:09:06 GMT+0300 (GMT+03:00): GVL_Test.IncrementingValue changed to 277
...
```

## Reading and writing raw data

It's possible to read and write raw data using ads-client. Reading will result in a `Buffer` object, that contains the read data as bytes. Writing accepts a `Buffer` object that is then written to the PLC.

Handling raw data is usually the most fastest and efficient way, as there is usually much less network traffic required. The methods require known `indexGroup` and `indexOffset` values.

### Getting symbol index group, offset and size

Variable symbol information can be acquired with method `getSymbolInfo`. The symbol infoc contains required `indexGroup`, `indexOffset` and `size`.

```js
const info = await client.getSymbolInfo('GVL_Test.TestINT')
console.log(info)
/*
{ indexGroup: 16448,
  indexOffset: 414816,
  size: 2,
  dataType: 2,
  dataTypeStr: 'ADST_INT16',
  flags: 8,
  flagsStr: [ 'TypeGuid' ],
  arrayDimension: 0,
  nameLength: 16,
  typeLength: 3,
  commentLength: 0,
  name: 'GVL_Test.TestINT',
  type: 'INT',
  comment: '' }
*/
```

### Reading a single raw value
```js
//Reading DINT from indexGroup 16448 and indexOffset 411836 (4 bytes)
const result = await client.readRaw(16448, 411836, 4)
console.log(result) //<Buffer 37 61 00 00>
```

### Writing a single raw value
```js
//Writing value 123 to DINT from indexGroup 16448 and indexOffset 411836 (4 bytes)
const data = Buffer.alloc(4)
data.writeInt32LE(123)

await client.writeRaw(16448, 411836, data)
```

### Reading multiple raw values

Starting from version 1.3.0 you can use ADS sum commands to read multiple values in a single request. This is faster than reading one by one.

Method returns an array of results, one result object for each read operation. If result has `success` of true, the read was succesful and data is located in `data`. Otherwise error information can be read from `errorInfo`.

```js
const result = await client.readRawMulti([
  {
    indexGroup: 16448,
    indexOffset: 411836,
    size: 4
  },{
    indexGroup: 123, //Note: Incorrect on purpose
    indexOffset: 436040,
    size: 255
  }
])
console.log(result)
/*
[ { success: true,
    errorInfo: { error: false, errorCode: 0, errorStr: 'No error' },
    target: { indexGroup: 16448, indexOffset: 411836 },
    data: <Buffer 00 43 3a d4> },
  { success: false,
    errorInfo:
     { error: true, errorCode: 1794, errorStr: 'Invalid index group' },
    target: { indexGroup: 123, indexOffset: 436040 },
    data:
     <Buffer 00 00 00 00 ... > } ]
*/
```

### Writing multiple raw values

Starting from version 1.3.0 you can use ADS sum commands to write multiple values in a single request. This is faster than writing one by one.

Method returns an array of results, one result object for each write operation. If result has `success` of true, the write was succesful. Otherwise error information can be read from `errorInfo`.

```js
//Create raw data for DINT with value 555
const data = Buffer.alloc(4)
data.writeInt32LE(555)

const result = await client.writeRawMulti([
  {
    indexGroup: 16448,
    indexOffset: 411836,
    data: data
  },{
    indexGroup: 123, //Note: Incorrect on purpose
    indexOffset: 436040,
    data: Buffer.alloc(255)
  }
])
console.log(result)
/*
[ { success: true,
    errorInfo: { error: false, errorCode: 0, errorStr: 'No error' },
    target: { indexGroup: 16448, indexOffset: 411836 } },
  { success: false,
    errorInfo:
     { error: true,
       errorCode: 1793,
       errorStr: 'Service is not supported by server' },
    target: { indexGroup: 123, indexOffset: 436040 } } ]
*/
```

### Creating a variable handle and reading a raw value

Using handles is another alternative for reading and writing raw data. A handle is first made using variable name and then using the returned handle, read and write operations can be made. No need to know `indexGroup` and `indexOffset`.

NOTE: Handles should always be deleted if no more used. This doesn't mean that it wouldn't be a good habit to use the same handle all the time (for example in application backend until app is terminated). The reason is that there are limited number of handles available.

```js
const handle = await client.createVariableHandle('GVL_Test.TestINT')
console.log(handle)
//{ handle: 905969897, size: 2, type: 'INT' }

const result = await client.readRawByHandle(handle)
console.log(result)
//<Buffer d2 04>

await client.deleteVariableHandle(handle)
```


### Creating a variable handle and writing a raw value

See *Creating a variable handle and reading a raw value* for more info about handles.

```js
const handle = await client.createVariableHandle('GVL_Test.TestINT')
console.log(handle)
//{ handle: 905969897, size: 2, type: 'INT' }

//Create raw data for INT with value 12345
const data = Buffer.alloc(2)
data.writeInt32LE(12345)

await client.writeRawByHandle(handle, data)
await client.deleteVariableHandle(handle)
```

### Creating and deleting multiple variable handles

Since version 1.10.0 it is possible to create and delete multiple handles at once. This is faster than one by one as everything is sent in one packet. 

**NOTE:** It `createVariableHandleMulti()` returns only the handle as number. No size and data type are returned as in `createVariableHandle()`.

```js
//Create three handles at once
const handles = (await client.createVariableHandleMulti([
  'GVL_Test.TestINT',
  'GVL_Test.TestENUM',
  'GVL_Test.THIS_IS_NOT_FOUND'
]))

console.log(handles)
/*
[
  {
    success: true,
    errorInfo: { error: false, errorCode: 0, errorStr: 'No error' },
    target: 'GVL_Test.TestINT',
    handle: 570425600
  },
  {
    success: true,
    errorInfo: { error: false, errorCode: 0, errorStr: 'No error' },
    target: 'GVL_Test.TestENUM',
    handle: 570425601
  },
  {
    success: false,
    errorInfo: { error: true, errorCode: 1808, errorStr: 'Symbol not found' },
    target: 'GVL_Test.THIS_IS_NOT_FOUND',
    handle: null
  }
]
*/

//Read data from first handle, note that raw methods understand object as input
console.log(await client.readRawByHandle(handles[0])) //Output: <Buffer d2 04>

//Read data from second handle, note that only handle number is given
console.log(await client.readRawByHandle(handles[1].handle)) //Output: <Buffer 64 00>

//Delete handles
await client.deleteVariableHandleMulti(handles)
```



### Converting a raw value to Javascript object
Using `convertFromRaw` method, raw data can be converted to Javascript object. The conversion works internally like in `readSymbol`.

```js
//result = <Buffer 37 61 00 00>
const value = await client.convertFromRaw(result, 'DINT')
console.log(value) //24887
```

Example with `readRawMulti` and custom struct:
```js
const result = await client.readRawMulti([
  {
    indexGroup: 16448,
    indexOffset: 449659,
    size: 59
  },{
    indexGroup: 16448,
    indexOffset: 436040,
    size: 255
  }
])

const value = await client.convertFromRaw(result[0].data, 'ST_Example')
console.log(value)
/*
{ SomeText: 'Hello ads-client',
  SomeReal: 3.1415927410125732,
  SomeDate: 2020-04-13T12:25:33.000Z }
*/
```

### Converting a Javascript object to raw value
Using `convertToRaw` method, Javascript object can be converted to raw data. The conversion works internally like in `writeSymbol`.


```js
const data = await client.convertToRaw(12345, 'INT')
console.log(data) //<Buffer 39 30>
```

The 3rd parameter `autoFill` works as in `writeSymbol`.
```js
const data = await client.convertToRaw(
  {
    SomeText: 'Hello ads-client',
    SomeReal: 3.1415927410125732,
  }, 'ST_Example', true //NOTE: autoFill=true (as there is no SomeDate given)
)
console.log(data)
//<Buffer 48 65 6c 6c 6f 20 ... >
```

## Reading and writing `POINTER TO` and `REFERENCE TO` variables

It's also possible to work with both `POINTER TO xxx` and `REFERENCE TO xxx` variables with `ads-client`.

- Note that using `ReadSymbol()` and `WriteSymbol()` is not possible
- Easiest way to read is `readRawByName()`
- Writing is can be done with `createVariableHandle()`, which is suitable for reading too
- Pointers require dereference operator ^ in order to work


### Reading a `REFERENCE TO` value

The value needs to be read as a raw Buffer first and then it can be converted to correct data type. `createVariableHandle()` works too but this is slightly faster and easier.

```js
//GVL_Test has variable TestREFERENCE : REFERENCE TO ST_Example;

const value = await client.convertFromRaw(
  await client.readRawByName('GVL_Test.TestREFERENCE'),
  'ST_Example'
)
console.log(value)
/*
{
  SomeText: 'Hello ads-client',
  SomeReal: 3.1415927410125732,
  SomeDate: 2020-04-13T12:25:33.000Z
}
*/
```


### Writing a `REFERENCE TO` value

In order to write a reference, a variable handle needs to be created. Also the data neeeds to be converted to a raw Buffer before writing.

```js
//GVL_Test has variable TestREFERENCE : REFERENCE TO ST_Example;

const value = {
  SomeText: 'Hello reference variable',
  SomeReal: 12345,
  SomeDate: new Date()
}

//Creating handle to the varialbe
const handle = await client.createVariableHandle('GVL_Test.TestREFERENCE')

//Writing raw Buffer data that is first created from object
await client.writeRawByHandle(
  handle,
  await client.convertToRaw(value, 'ST_Example')
)

//Always delete the handle if not reusing it later
await client.deleteVariableHandle(handle)
```



### Reading a `POINTER TO` value

Similar as with reference except that a dereference operator `^` is required.

```js
//GVL_Test has variable TestPOINTER : POINTER TO ST_Example;

const value = await client.convertFromRaw(
  await client.readRawByName('GVL_Test.TestPOINTER^'), //note ^
  'ST_Example'
)
console.log(value)
/*
{
  SomeText: 'Hello ads-client',
  SomeReal: 3.1415927410125732,
  SomeDate: 2020-04-13T12:25:33.000Z
}
*/
```


### Writing a `POINTER TO` value

Similar as with reference except that a dereference operator `^` is required.

```js
//GVL_Test has variable TestPOINTER : POINTER TO ST_Example;

const value = {
  SomeText: 'Hello pointer variable',
  SomeReal: 12345,
  SomeDate: new Date()
}

//Creating handle to the varialbe
const handle = await client.createVariableHandle('GVL_Test.TestPOINTER^') //note ^

//Writing raw Buffer data that is first created from object
await client.writeRawByHandle(
  handle,
  await client.convertToRaw(value, 'ST_Example')
)

//Always delete the handle if not reusing it later
await client.deleteVariableHandle(handle)
```


## Calling a function block method with parameters using RPC (remote procedure call)
Starting from version 1.8.0, it is possible to call function block methods directly from Node.js. Input and output parameters are available as well as method return value. **Only supported on TwinCAT 3.**

---
**WARNING - IMPORTANT NOTE**
- Do not use online change if you change RPC method parameters or return data types
- Make sure that parameters and return value have no `pack-mode` pragmas defined, otherwise data might be corrupted
- Do not use `ARRAY` values directly in parameters or return value, encapsulate arrays inside struct and use the struct instead
- The feature is new and there might some bugs as it's not well documented by Beckhoff
---

In the following example we have a function block named `FB_RpcTest`. There is an instance of it at global variable list with a path of `GVL_Test.RpcTest`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13457157/86382902-9cccb880-bc96-11ea-83b8-daae9de65a66.png)

### Calling a simple RPC method

The code of `Calculator` method is the following. It has also VAR_OUTPUT parameters. Idea is that calculation is returned as outputs and return value tells if it was succesful.
```
{attribute 'TcRpcEnable'}
METHOD Calculator : BOOL
VAR_INPUT
  Value1	: REAL;
  Value2	: REAL;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
  Sum       : REAL;
  Product   : REAL;
  Division  : REAL;
END_VAR

//--- Code begins ---

//Return TRUE if all success
Calculator := TRUE;

Sum := Value1 + Value2;
Product := Value1 * Value2;

IF Value2 <> 0 THEN
	Division := Value1 / Value2;
ELSE
	Division := 0;
	Calculator := FALSE;
END_IF
```

The method can be called from Node.js:
```js
const result = await client.invokeRpcMethod("GVL_Test.RpcTest","Calculator", {
    Value1: 100.50,
    Value2: 2.2
})

console.log(result)

/*
Example console output:

{
  returnValue: true,
  outputs: {
    Sum: 102.69999694824219,
    Product: 221.10000610351562,
    Division: 45.68181610107422
  }
}
*/
```

### Using structs with RPC methods

The code of the `StructTest` method is following. It has only one input and a return value (both are structs).

```
{attribute 'TcRpcEnable'}
METHOD StructTest : ST_Example
VAR_INPUT
	Input	: ST_Example;
END_VAR

//--- Code begins ---

StructTest.SomeText := CONCAT('Response: ', Input.SomeText);
StructTest.SomeReal := Input.SomeReal * 10.0;
StructTest.SomeDate := Input.SomeDate + T#24H;
```
The method can be called from Node.js:

```js
const result = await client.invokeRpcMethod("GVL_Test.RpcTest","StructTest", {
  Input: {
    SomeText: 'Hello RPC method',
    SomeReal: 1200.50,
    SomeDate: new Date() //2020-07-03T14:57:22.000Z
  }
})

console.log(result)
/*
Example console output:

{
  returnValue: {
    SomeText: 'Response: Hello RPC method',
    SomeReal: 12005,
    SomeDate: 2020-07-03T15:57:22.000Z
  },
  outputs: {}
}
*/
```


## Starting and stopping the PLC

The PLC runtime(s) can be started and stopped using following methods. Internally `WriteControl()` is used.

Note that all following methods will fail, if the PLC is already in the target state.

**Starting the PLC**
```js
await client.startPlc() //Start the PLC from settings.targetAdsPort
await client.startPlc(852) //Start the PLC from ADS port 852
```

**Stopping the PLC**
```js
await client.stopPlc() //Stop the PLC from settings.targetAdsPort
await client.stopPlc(852) //Stop the PLC from ADS port 852
```

**Restarting the PLC**
```js
await client.restartPlc() //Restart the PLC from settings.targetAdsPort
await client.restartPlc(852) //Restart the PLC from ADS port 852
```

**Reading the PLC state**

The PLC runtime state can always be read using `readPlcRuntimeState()` and the latest known state of PLC runtime at `settings.targetAdsPort` is located in `metaData.plcRuntimeState`.
```js
await client.readPlcRuntimeState() //Read PLC runtime status from settings.targetAdsPort 
//Example result: { adsState: 5, adsStateStr: 'Run', deviceState: 0 }
await client.readPlcRuntimeState(852) //Read PLC runtime status from ADS port 852
```

## Starting and stopping the TwinCAT system

The TwinCAT system can be started and set to config mode using following methods. This can be useful for example when updating the PLC software. Internally `WriteControl()` is used.

Note that all following methods will fail, if the system is already in the target state/mode.

**Setting the TwinCAT system to run mode**
```js
await client.setSystemManagerToRun()
```
**Setting the TwinCAT system to config mode**
```js
await client.setSystemManagerToConfig()
```
**Restart TwinCAT system**
```js
//Same as calling setSystemManagerToRun()
await client.restartSystemManager()
```

**Reading the TwinCAT system state**

The TwinCAT system state can always be read using `readSystemManagerState()` and the latest known state is located in `metaData.systemManagerState`.
```js
await client.readSystemManagerState() //{ adsState: 5, adsStateStr: 'Run', deviceState: 1 }
```

## Sending custom ADS commands

Since version 1.11.0 it's possible to send any custom ADS commands using `sendAdsCommand()`

**Example:** Read device info from system manager
```js
//Read device info from system manager (port 10000)
const result = await client.sendAdsCommand(
  ads.ADS.ADS_COMMAND.ReadDeviceInfo,
  Buffer.alloc(0),
  10000
)
console.log(result)
/*
{
  amsTcp: { command: 0, commandStr: 'Ads command', dataLength: 56 },
  ams: {
    targetAmsNetId: '192.168.5.131.1.1',
    targetAdsPort: 37538,
    sourceAmsNetId: '192.168.5.131.1.1',
    sourceAdsPort: 10000,
    adsCommand: 1,
    adsCommandStr: 'ReadDeviceInfo',
    stateFlags: 5,
    stateFlagsStr: 'Response, AdsCommand, Tcp',
    dataLength: 24,
    errorCode: 0,
    invokeId: 7,
    error: false,
    errorStr: ''
  },
  ads: {
    rawData: <Buffer 00 00 00 00 03 01 b8 0f 54 77 69 6e 43 41 54 20 53 79 73 74 65 6d 00 00>,
    errorCode: 0,
    data: {
      majorVersion: 3,
      minorVersion: 1,
      versionBuild: 4024,
      deviceName: 'TwinCAT System'
    },
    error: false
  }
}
*/
```

**Example:** Read all ADS routes from target system

See this gist for a simple example how to read all TwinCAT routes from target system:

https://gist.github.com/jisotalo/cfcc9e4935dfc6f391667cad2cdcb6c6

    - Emitted when connection is re-established (like after connectionLost event)

## Example: Printing to console when PLC runtime state changes:
```js
client.on('plcRuntimeStateChange', state => {
  console.log('State is now:', state)
})

//When PLC is stopped:
//State is now: { adsState: 6, adsStateStr: 'Stop', deviceState: 0 }
``` 

## Example: Catching an error that is not directly from a method call
```js
client.on('ads-client-error', err => {
  console.log('Error:', err.message)
})
//When unknown notification data is received:
//Error: Ads notification received but it has unknown notificationHandle (30). Use unsubscribe() to save resources.
``` 




# Debugging
If you have problems or you are interested, you can enabled debug output to console. The ads-client uses `debug` package for debugging.

Debugging can be enabled from terminal or from Javascript code.

## Enabling debug from code

You can change the debug level with method `setDebugging(level)`:
```js
client.setDebugging(2)
```
Different debug levels explained:
- 0: No debugging (default)
- 1: Errors have full stack traces, no debug printing
- 2: Basic debug printing (same as `DEBUG='ads-client'`) 
- 3: Detailed debug printing (same as `DEBUG='ads-client,ads-client:details'`)
- 4: Detailed debug printing and raw I/O data (same as `DEBUG='ads-client*'`)

## Enabling debugging from terminal
See the [debug package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) for instructions.

Example for Visual Studio Code (PowerShell):
```bash
$env:DEBUG='ads-client,ads-client:details'
```

Different debug levels explained:
- Basic debug printing `DEBUG='ads-client'`
- Basic and detailed debug printing `DEBUG='ads-client,ads-client:details'`
- Basic, detailed and raw I/O data: `DEBUG='ads-client*'`

# FAQ 

### Connection is working very badly and lot's of timeouts
Possible fixes: 
- Remove all routes and create them again
- Increase timeout delay setting (`timeoutDelay`)
- If you have very fast subscriptions, try to cache all data types before subscribing using `readAndCacheDataTypes()` 

### When using JSON.stringify or similar I'm getting a `TypeError: Do not know how to serialize a BigInt`
- JSON.stringify doesn't understand BigInt (64 bit integer) values as default
- Use setting `disableBigInt: true` to receive Buffer objects instead of BigInts
- Another solution is to use something like [this](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/jsbi/issues/30#issuecomment-521460510)

### Can I connect from Raspberry Pi to TwinCAT?

Absolutely. See chapter "Supported platforms and setups", but basically:
1. Open a TCP port 48898 from your PLC
2. Edit StaticRoutes.xml file from your PLC
3. Connect from Raspberry using the PLC IP address as router address and the local AMS Net Id you wrote to StaticRoutes.xml

### Receiving ADS error 1808 `Symbol not found` even when it should be found

- Make sure you have updated the latest PLC software using *download*. It seems that online change isn't updating everything.
- If you are using TwinCAT 2, see chapter [IMPORTANT: Things to know when using with TwinCAT 2](#important-things-to-know-when-using-with-twincat-2)

### Having timeouts and/or 'mailbox is full' errors when sending lot's of ADS commands

- The AMS router is capable of handling only limited number of requests in a certain time. 
- Other possible reason is that operating system TCP window is full because of large number of requests.

Solution: 
- Use structs or arrays to send data in larger packets 
- Try raw/multi commands to decrease data usage

### Having problems to connect from OSX or Raspberry Pi to target PLC

- You need to connect to the PLC AMS router instead

Solution:
- See [this issue comment](https://github.com/jisotalo/ads-client/issues/51#issuecomment-758016428) by hansipete how to do it.



### A data type is not found even when it should be

If you use methods like `convertFromRaw()` and `getDataType()` but receive an error similar to `ClientException: Finding data type *data type* failed`, make sure you have really written the data type correctly.

For example, when copying a variable name from TwinCAT online view using CTRL+C, it might not work:
- Displayed name: `ARRAY [0..1, 0..1] OF ST_Example`
- The value copied to clipboard `ARRAY [0..1, 0..1] OF ST_Example`
- --> **This causes error!**
- The real data type name that needs to be used is `ARRAY [0..1,0..1] OF ST_Example` (note no whitespace between array dimensions)

If you have problems, try to read the variable information using `readSymbolInfo()`. The final solution is to read all data types using `readAndCacheDataTypes()` and manually finding the correct type.
